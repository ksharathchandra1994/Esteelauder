DevOps: It is Software development approach which involves Continues Development, Continues Testing, Continues integration, Continues Deployment, Continues Monitoring throughout its development life-cycle 
	
1.Version control system (Source code management) git 
2.Continues integration : It is building application continuously, After doing changes CI tool pulls the latest code and prepares the build, Preparing means it includes below action 
	* Compiling source code
	* Validating 
	* Reviewing 
	* Unit Testing
	* integration Testing
	* Packing Application 

3.Continues Delivery : Jenkins deploys build in to test servers to perform the user acceptance  testing with help of Selenium. Once it is done the build will be deployed in to prod servers

CI Tool:
	* If any changes done in Source code, It takes code and makes build with help of Build automation tools like Maven, Gradle, Ant
	* Once build is deployed in test servers, It test source code with help of Selenium 
	* After completion of Testing, It deploys the build in to PROD server 
		* to deploy the code to servers we use tools like Docker, Pappet  
	* Once build is deployed to Prod Server, It will continuously monitored with help of tools like Nagives, Plank, Elk Stack

Continues integration:	Version Control --> Build --> Unit Test --> Deploy To Test Servers --> Automation Testing --> Deploy To Production 
	
	* Once Developers write the code, They commit the code Version control system  (Git/SVN ) with proper version tags (For tracking purpose)-- VC
	* Here we merge code the from various branches of repository, Code compiling - Build
	* Unit Testing (Here, We break software in to different individual units, perform test ), Then Integration Testing (Here we check integration between individual units) - Unit Testing
	* Build deployment in to Test Servers - Deploy
	* Automation Testing (Acceptance Testing)
	* Build Deploying in to PRODUCTION
